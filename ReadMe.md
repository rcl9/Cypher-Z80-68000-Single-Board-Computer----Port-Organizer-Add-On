# Port Organizer and Break-Out Box Add-On for the Cypher Z80/68000 SBC (1985-era)

This repository documents the rather simple port organizer and break-out box that I had designed and built for the [Motel Computers Cypher Z80/68000 SBC](https://github.com/rcl9/Cypher-Z80-68000-Single-Board-Computer-1984-by-Motel-Computers---History-and-Documentation) in 1985.

The Cypher single board computer provided a lot of interesting functionality but no connectors for RS-232, video, keyboard, etc. that would otherwise come standard with IBM PC computers. 

It provided this additional functionality:

- Composite-out video converter

- Monochrome video output connector

- RS-232 serial port A (DTE pinout)

- Serial keyboard interface (for a Nabu keyboard from a Volker-Craig 4404 terminal)

- MIDI input and output ports
